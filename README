Service Bus MQ Manager - v2.00 Alpha
======================================================================
An application to view and manage Service Bus messages.

## Overview
Service Bus MQ Manager works by monitoring a Queue (currently MSMQ) and parsing the Messages presenting them in a list sorted by Commands, Events, Messages and Errors. Currently there is only support for NServiceBus, even though you could use other Service Bus, but you would lose some niceties such as list item namings and infrastructure messages showing up in the queue.

The application is most useful when used in a [CQRS architecture](http://cqrsinfo.com), where its common to send Commands and Event messages using a Service Bus.

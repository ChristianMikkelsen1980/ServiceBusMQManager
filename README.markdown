Service Bus MQ Manager - v2.xx
======================================================================
An application to view and manage Service Bus messages.

## Overview
Service Bus MQ Manager works by monitoring a Queue (currently MSMQ) and parsing the Messages presenting them in a list sorted by Commands, Events, Messages and Errors. Currently there is only support for NServiceBus, even though you could use other Service Bus, but you would lose some niceties such as list item namings and infrastructure messages showing up in the queue.

The application is most useful when used in a [CQRS architecture](http://cqrsinfo.com), where its common to send Commands and Event messages using a Service Bus.

- **Monitor Queues**, Monitor queues for incoming Commands, Events and Messages envelops, also possible to monitor Error Queue
- **Remove messages**, remove messages from queues
- **Retry failed messages**, Move messages from Error queue to its original queue
- **Send Command**, Build and send commands in an user friendly interface The commands can later be sent directly from command prompt
- **View Subscriptions**, View what Events are being subscribed and who is publishing them
- **Service Bus Integration**, Supports NServiceBus with MSMQ XML and JSON Transportation.
